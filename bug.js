This error occurs when you try to access a state variable before it has been initialized.  This often happens when you're using `useState` and trying to access the state value immediately within the component's initial render.  Because React's state updates are asynchronous, the initial value might not be available at the moment you expect it.

```javascript
// Incorrect code
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function MyComponent() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>Count: {count + 1}</Text> {/* Error: count might be undefined */} 
      <Button title="Increment" onPress={() => setCount(count + 1)} />
    </View>
  );
}
```
